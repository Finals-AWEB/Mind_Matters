    <h3>How to cope and overcome Mental Health Problems</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned by <span>{{ authors }}</span> ({{ publicationDate_blog }}), stress can come from both external and internal factors. External stressors, such as workload or financial difficulties, may often be managed through proactive solutions like time management or financial planning. On the other hand, internal stressors related to mindset and attitude require personal coping strategies to ensure mental well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to <span>{{ authors }}</span> ({{ publicationDate_blog }}), exercise is an effective way to combat stress, improving mood and energy levels. Proper sleep habits also play a crucial role in reducing stress, as sleep deprivation can negatively affect focus and increase anxiety. Additionally, financial concerns are a leading cause of stress, making money management an important skill for students.
    </p>

    <p>
        As stated by <span>{{ authors }}</span> ({{ publicationDate_blog }}), adjusting one’s attitude can significantly influence stress levels. A positive mindset helps students handle academic and personal challenges with resilience. Engaging in enjoyable activities, practicing mindfulness, or listening to music can contribute to overall well-being. Furthermore, relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation have been proven to alleviate stress and enhance mental clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
        As highlighted by <span>{{ authors }}</span> ({{ publicationDate_blog }}), students should explore different stress management techniques that work best for them. When stress becomes overwhelming, seeking guidance and support is essential. Acknowledging the need for help is a step towards maintaining a healthy balance in life.
